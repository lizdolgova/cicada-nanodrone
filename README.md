# cicada-nanodrone

This is my personal research project focused on developing an insect-scale surveillance drone inspired by cicadas.

The lab is in very early development, and everything is subject to change. I’ll be documenting each step—from initial research to hands-on prototyping, hardware selection, and AI experimentation.

Feedback and collaboration are welcome as the project evolves.
